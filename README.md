# Injury Severity Prediction Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting the severity of injuries sustained in traffic accidents in Tempe City using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical traffic accident data, we aim to understand the factors influencing injury severity and provide insights for enhancing traffic safety measures.

## Dataset Overview

The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset provided by the city of Tempe, available at [this link](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/1-08-crash-data-report-detail-498c3). The dataset includes detailed information on vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian collisions, classifying each incident by severity and documenting the location and nature of these events.

## Methodology

Our approach involves employing various machine learning algorithms to identify trends and correlations within the data that can illuminate the dynamics behind high-severity traffic incidents. We specifically explore models such as RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, and Multinomial Naive Bayes to predict injury outcomes and evaluate their effectiveness.

## Findings

The analysis provides valuable insights into the predictors of injury severity in traffic accidents and evaluates the performance of different machine learning models in forecasting these outcomes. Our findings aim to contribute to the development of targeted safety interventions and improvements in traffic safety management in Tempe City.
